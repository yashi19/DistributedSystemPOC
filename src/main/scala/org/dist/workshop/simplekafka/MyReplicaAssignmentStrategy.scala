  /**
   * There are 2 goals of replica assignment:
   * 1. Spread the replicas evenly among brokers.
   * 2. For partitions assigned to a particular broker, their other replicas are spread over the other brokers.
   *
   * To achieve this goal, we:
   * 1. Assign the first replica of each partition by round-robin, starting from a random position in the broker list.
   * 2. Assign the remaining replicas of each partition with an increasing shift.
   *
   * Here is an example of assigning
   * broker-0  broker-1  broker-2  broker-3  broker-4
   * p0        p1        p2        p3        p4       (1st replica)
   * p5        p6        p7        p8        p9       (1st replica)
   * p4        p0        p1        p2        p3       (2nd replica)
   * p8        p9        p5        p6        p7       (2nd replica)
   * p3        p4        p0        p1        p2       (3nd replica)
   * p7        p8        p9        p5        p6       (3nd replica)
